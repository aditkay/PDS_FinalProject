    "Once we have the team statistics for each NBA team, in order to extend our feature set, we will also take player statistics into consideration. In the end, we will combine both team and individual statistics for each team. For that matter, we came up with the idea of computing performance score for each player, then taking an average of individual performance scores of players for each team. The only thing we should think about is the way we could possibly calculate individual scores based on their historical data.\n",

When a highly efficient player is dropped from a team, the team's winning percentage could drop signinficanly for the remaining season. This is why we considered John Hollinger's PER, which allows us to compare players even when there is a disparity in their minutes played.

The teams in the NBA go through the a lot of changes every year so it is only resonable to restrict our training data to a particular year. A study by Harvard Sports Analysis, states that for winning NBA games 'offense matters slightly more.' So we will try to focus slightly more on offensive stats, but will give an adequate amount of importance to defensive stats while considering features as well. The following function `add_stat` takes the link of the webpage that is compatible with lxml parsing and the name of the feature to be added. This lets us add features with ease and eventually select the ones that will get us more accuracy in prediction.  "
